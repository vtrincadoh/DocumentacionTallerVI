	abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) report high levels of co-occurring mood disorders. Previous work suggests that people with ASD also experience aberrant responses to social reward compared to typically developing (TD) peers. In the TD population, aberrant reward processing has been linked to anhedonia (i.e., loss of pleasure), which is a hallmark feature of depression. This study examined the interplay between self-reported pleasure from social and nonsocial rewards, autism symptom severity, loneliness, and depressive symptoms across adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; N = 49), TD currently depressed adults (TD-dep; N = 30), and TD never depressed controls (TD-con; N = 28). The ASD cohort reported levels of social and nonsocial anhedonia that were greater than TD-con but not significantly different from TD-dep. Across cohorts, both social and nonsocial hedonic capacity moderated the relationship between autism symptoms and loneliness: individuals with low capacity for pleasure experienced elevated loneliness regardless of autism symptom severity, while those with intact capacity for pleasure (i.e., less anhedonia) experienced greater loneliness as a function of increased autism symptoms. Loneliness was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms across clinical cohorts. Our findings suggest a putative pathway from trait-like anhedonia in ASD to depression via elevated loneliness and indicate that variability in hedonic capacity within the autism spectrum may differentially confer risk for depression in adults with ASD. Results underscore potential mental health benefits of social skills interventions and community inclusion programs for adults with ASD. Autism Res 2019, 12: 884–896. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary The relationship between autism symptoms and loneliness depended on one's ability to experience both social and nonsocial pleasure. Adults who experienced less pleasure reported high levels of loneliness that did not depend autism severity, while adults with high capacity for pleasure were especially lonely if they also had many autism symptoms. Loneliness was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms, compared to capacity for social and nonsocial pleasure and autism symptoms.},

	abstract = {In the rubber hand illusion, perceived hand ownership can be transferred to a rubber hand after synchronous visual and tactile stimulation. Perceived body ownership and self–other relation are foundational for development of self-awareness, imitation, and empathy, which are all affected in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We examined the rubber hand illusion in children with and without ASD. Children with ASD were initially less susceptible to the illusion than the comparison group, yet showed the effects of the illusion after 6 minutes. Delayed susceptibility to the illusion may result from atypical multisensory temporal integration and/or an unusually strong reliance on proprioception. Children with ASD who displayed less empathy were significantly less likely to experience the illusion than those with more intact ability to express empathy. A better understanding of body representation in ASD may elucidate neural underpinnings of social deficits, thus informing future intervention approaches.},

	abstract = {Autism is strongly associated with sensory processing difficulties. We investigate sensory habituation, given its relevance for understanding important phenotypic traits like hyper- and hypo-sensitivities. We collected electroencephalography data from 22 neuro-typical(NT) and 13 autistic(ASD) children during the presentation of visual and auditory sequences of repeated stimuli. Our data show that the ASD children have significantly reduced habituation relative to the NT children for both auditory and visual stimuli. These results point to impaired habituation as a modality-general phenomenon in ASD. Additionally, the rates of habituation are correlated with several clinical scores associated with competence along diverse phenotypic dimensions. These data suggest that the sensory difficulties in autism are likely to be associated with reduced habituation and are related to clinical symptomology.},

	abstract = {Motor impairments are pervasive in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); however, children with ASD rarely receive a dual diagnosis of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). The Simons Foundation SPARK study engaged families affected by ASD through an online study.The DCD parent questionnaire (DCDQ) was used to assess the prevalence of a risk for motor impairment or DCD in children with ASD between 5 and 15 years of age.This study utilizes parent reports from a large database of children with ASD.A total of 16,705 parents of children with ASD completed the DCDQ. We obtained our final SPARK dataset (n = 11,814) after filtering out invalid data, using stronger cut-offs to confirm ASD traits, and excluding children with general neuromotor impairments/intellectual delays. We compared DCDQ total and subscale scores from the SPARK dataset with published norms for each age between 5 and 15 years.The proportion of children with ASD at risk for a motor impairment was very high at 86.9\%. Children with ASD did not outgrow their motor impairments and continued to present with a risk for DCD even into adolescence. Yet, only 31.6\% of children were receiving physical therapy services.Our analysis of a large database of parent-reported outcomes using the DCDQ did not involve follow-up clinical assessments.Using a large sample of children with ASD, this study shows that a risk for motor impairment or DCD was present in most children with ASD and persists into adolescence; however, only a small proportion of children with ASD were receiving physical therapist interventions. A diagnosis of ASD must trigger motor screening, evaluations, and appropriate interventions by physical and occupational therapists to address the functional impairments of children with ASD while also positively impacting their social communication, cognition, and behavior. Using valid motor measures, future research must determine if motor impairment is a fundamental feature of ASD.},

	abstract = {Sensory processing and motor issues are common among individuals with ASD and impact health, well-being and quality of life. Much of the brain is involved in the processing the various types of sensory input, which include tactile, auditory, visual, gustatory, olfactory, proprioceptive, vestibular, and interoception. Sensory system pathways by which the brain receives information, interprets the stimulus, and implements a response are often atypical in children with ASD. Individuals with ASD usually demonstrate several general response patterns, dependent on the assessment used in the study, including: inattentive, seeking, sensory modulation with movement sensitivity, and sensory modulation with taste/smell sensitivity, or sensory adaptive, taste and smell sensitive, postural inattentive, and generalized sensory disorder. Sensory-based motor disorders include both postural disorder and dyspraxia. Sensory processing problems are linked to activity participation difficulty in individuals with ASD and can also be difficult for families to manage. Individuals with ASD often demonstrate difficulties in a wide range of motor skills, which include fine manual control/writing, manual dexterity/coordination, ball skills, gait, balance, body coordination, strength and agility, praxis, imitation, postural stability, and speed, and in the subtle neurological signs of overflow, dysrhythmia, motor impersistence, and muscle tone. Poor motor skills can be explained by neural connectivity idiosyncrasies, particularly between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex. The most common therapeutic approaches used for sensory and motor intervention in children with ASD are sensory integration, sensory interventions, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental and task expectation. It is important for interventions to focus on participation in meaningful activities or occupations, such as play, leisure, self-care, school activities, or social activities.},
